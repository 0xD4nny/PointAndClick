<h2>📌 Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This project was part of my training to enhance my programming skills, particularly in UI design, game logic, and real-time rendering.
  The goal was to develop a Point and Click game with increasing difficulty, requiring players to react quickly while tracking their progress on a leaderboard.
</p>

<h2>🎮 Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
<div>🔵 Circles spawn, grow up to 100 pixels, and shrink before disappearing.</div>
<div>⚡ As the game progresses, circles appear faster and at higher frequencies.</div>
<div>🖱️ Players must click circles before they vanish to score points.</div>
<div>❌ Missed circles or misclicks result in lost lives.</div>
<div>❤️ Lives reset at the start of each round and increase as the player progresses.</div>
<div>🛑 The game ends when all lives are lost.</div>
<div>📊 Leaderboard tracks player performance for comparison and improvement.</div>

<h2>✨ Features</h2>
<div>✅ Dynamic circle animations (growth & shrink effect).</div>
<div>✅ Scaling difficulty system for increasing challenge.</div>
<div>✅ Custom UI components, including rounded buttons and smooth edges.</div>
<div>✅ Fullscreen mode for an immersive gaming experience.</div>
<div>✅ Leaderboard stored in XML to track top players.</div>
<div>✅ Optimized performance for smooth frame rates.</div>

<h2>📂 Leaderboard & Data Management</h2>
<p>The game maintains a leaderboard stored in XML format, recording:</p>
<div>👤 Player Name</div>
<div>🎯 Score</div>
<div>❌ Missed Clicks</div>
<div>📊 Accuracy Percentage</div>
<div>🎮 Level Reached</div>
<div>⏳ Total Game Time</div>
<div>📅 Date & Time of Entry</div>

<h2>🛠 Technologies Used</h2>
<div>💻 C# (WinForms) for game logic and UI design.</div>
<div>🎨 Custom Controls for an enhanced user experience.</div>
<div>🖌️ Hatch Brushes for visually appealing graphics.</div>
<div>🗂 XML Serialization for structured leaderboard storage.</div>
<div>🎬 GDI+ (Graphics API) for smooth animations.</div>

<h2>🚀 Challenges & Lessons Learned</h2>
<div>📌 Ensuring smooth animations while handling real-time updates.</div>
<div>📌 Balancing dynamic game difficulty for all players.</div>
<div>📌 Managing XML-based leaderboard storage efficiently.</div>
<div>📌 Developing an event-driven UI system with quick response times.</div>
<div>📌 Keeping high performance as the game complexity increases.</div>

<p>
  This project was a valuable learning experience in game mechanics, UI design, and real-time rendering. 
  It remains a great reference for my development journey! 🚀</em>
