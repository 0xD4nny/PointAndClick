## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project was part of my training to enhance my programming skills,\
particularly in UI design, game logic, and real-time rendering.\
The goal was to develop a Point and Click game with increasing dfficulty,\
requiring players to react quickly while tracking their progress on a leaderboard.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay Mechanics
- Circles spawn, grow up to 100 pixels, and shrink before disappearing.
- As the game progresses, circles appear faster and at higher frequencies.
- Players must click circles before they vanish to score points.
- Missed circles or misclicks result in lost lives.
- Lives reset at the start of each round and increase as the player progresses.
- The game ends when all lives are lost.
- Leaderboard tracks player performance for comparison and improvement.

## âœ¨ Features
- Dynamic circle animations (growth & shrink effect).
- Scaling difficulty system for increasing challenge.
- Custom UI components, including rounded buttons and smooth edges.
- Fullscreen mode for an immersive gaming experience.
- Leaderboard stored in XML to track top players.
- Optimized performance for smooth frame rates.

## ðŸ“‚ Leaderboard & Data Management
The game maintains a leaderboard stored in XML format, recording:
- Player Name
- Score
- Missed Clicks
- Accuracy Percentage
- Level Reached
- Total Game Time
- Date & Time of Entry

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- C# (WinForms) for game logic and UI design.
- Custom Controls for an enhanced user experience.
- Hatch Brushes for visually appealing graphics.
- XML Serialization for structured leaderboard storage.
- GDI+ (Graphics API) for smooth animations.

## ðŸš€ Challenges & Lessons Learned
- Ensuring smooth animations while handling real-time updates.
- Balancing dynamic game difficulty for all players.
- Managing XML-based leaderboard storage efficiently.
- Developing an event-driven UI system with quick response times.
- Keeping high performance as the game complexity increases.

This project was a valuable learning experience in game mechanics, UI design, and real-time rendering.\
It remains a great reference for my development journey!ðŸš€
